# 🧩 Project Definition (WHAT WE ARE BUILDING)

This project is a:

👉 Social Blog / Community App
For learning purposes

Users can:

• create an account (custom auth, no Supabase Auth)
• create posts (text + multiple images)
• view a feed of posts
• view user profiles
• comment on posts
• attach images to comments
• react to posts/comments (like, etc.)
• upload avatars
• edit/delete their own content

---

## Core Features

### Users

- register / login / logout
- profile with avatar, display name, bio

### Posts

- create post
- text content
- multiple images
- update/delete own posts
- show author with avatar and display_name
- show how much time has passed

### Comments

- add comments
- optional images
- update/delete own comments
- show author with avatar and display_name
- show how much time has passed

### Reactions

- like/react to posts or comments
- counts per item

---

## UI Expectations

- feed style layout
- avatars everywhere
- image-heavy content
- fast scrolling lists
- cached images
- shimmer loading
- pagination ready

All screens must follow the architecture defined in this document.

# Agents Architecture Guide

Supabase + Provider + ChangeNotifier + Repository Pattern

This document defines the complete app architecture, database structure,
and responsibilities of every layer.

This is the single source of truth for how features must be built.

If code violates this guide, it is considered incorrect.

---

# 🎯 Goals

We want:

• clean architecture  
• fast queries  
• scalable structure  
• easy testing  
• maintainable code  
• strict separation of layers  
• deep linking support  
• future-proof (pagination, realtime, caching)  
• FULL custom authentication  
• ZERO Supabase Auth usage  
• optimized image loading  
• zero layout jank during loading

---

# Life cycle

Ensure pages that relies on data have their providers data ready before showing the screen
Use shimmer while fetching data
Utilize microtask,changenotifierproxyprovider, etc
Sample: On startup -> check/wait user login -> load data(shimmer/splash screen) -> data ready -> show screen

---

# State management

Use an async state class to handle async state
Use changenotifier provider, not just provider
Always use selector, do not use watch or anything that rebuilds entire widget, unless needed
Use value notifier if managing state of 1 value/object only

---

# 🧠 High-Level Architecture

UI (Widgets)  
↓  
ChangeNotifiers (State)  
↓  
Repositories (Business Logic)  
↓  
Services (Supabase only)  
↓  
Supabase (Database + Storage)

⚠️ Supabase Auth is NEVER used.

---

# 🚨 HARD RULES

❌ Widgets MUST NOT call Supabase  
❌ Widgets MUST NOT import Services  
❌ Widgets MUST NOT contain business logic  
❌ Widgets MUST NOT upload files  
❌ Widgets MUST NOT use Map<String,dynamic>  
❌ Widgets MUST NOT use Image.network

✅ Widgets talk ONLY to Notifiers  
✅ Providers talk ONLY to Repositories  
✅ Repositories talk ONLY to Services  
✅ Services talk ONLY to Supabase  
✅ ALL network images MUST use CachedNetworkImage  
✅ ALL loading states MUST use Shimmer

If any layer skips the chain → architecture is broken.

---

# 📦 REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES (MANDATORY)

```yaml
dependencies:
  cached_network_image: ^3.x
  shimmer: ^3.x
```

---

# Supabase already contains these tables:

users_jeremiah
posts_jeremiah
posts_image
comments_jeremiah
comment_images_jeremiah
reactions_jeremiah

Buckets:
avatars
post-images
comment-images

Row Level Security is disabled.
Do not generate SQL.
Use these tables as-is.
SQL Code to create tables in sql.txt
Inform user if it needs to update

---

# 🖼 IMAGE LOADING STANDARD (MANDATORY)

To ensure:

• disk caching  
• memory caching  
• smooth scrolling  
• zero flicker  
• graceful loading states  
• consistent UX

---

## ❌ NEVER

❌ Image.network  
❌ FadeInImage  
❌ manual loading spinners  
❌ custom skeleton loaders  
❌ loading logic inside notifiers

---

## ✅ ALWAYS

Use:

CachedNetworkImage + Shimmer

All remote images must:

• cache automatically  
• show shimmer placeholder  
• handle errors gracefully

---

# 🚨 IMAGE RULES

### MUST

for avatars, if user not uploaded image yet, use background color with first letter of their display_name or email
✅ cache automatically  
✅ show shimmer
use CachedNetworkImage

---

### MUST NOT

❌ Image.network

---

# 🔐 AUTHENTICATION (CUSTOM ONLY)

We DO NOT use Supabase Auth.

Authentication is fully handled using:

users_jeremiah table + password hashing

We implement:
• register  
• login  
• change password  
• logout  
• session cache

inside repositories.

---

# 🚨 AUTH RULES

### MUST

✅ store hashed passwords (bcrypt/argon2)  
✅ validate password in repository  
✅ cache session locally  
✅ treat users_jeremiah as the ONLY user source

### MUST NOT

❌ never use Supabase Auth  
❌ never store plaintext passwords  
❌ never validate password in UI

# Routing

Use Go_Router, handle auth gate/guard

---

# 🗄 DATABASE STRUCTURE

## users_jeremiah

id (uuid, PK)  
email (unique)  
password_hash  
display_name  
avatar_url  
bio  
created_at  
updated_at

⚠️ Handles BOTH auth + profile.

---

## posts_jeremiah

id  
author_id → users_jeremiah.id  
title  
content  
created_at  
updated_at

---

## posts_image

id  
post_id → posts_jeremiah.id  
url

---

## comments_jeremiah

id  
post_id → posts_jeremiah.id  
author_id → users_jeremiah.id  
content  
created_at  
updated_at

---

## comment_images_jeremiah

id  
comment_id → comments_jeremiah.id  
url

---

## reactions_jeremiah

id  
user_id  
post_id (nullable)  
comment_id (nullable)  
reaction_type

# 🔴 CRITICAL FETCH RULE (VERY IMPORTANT)

## Posts and Comments MUST ALWAYS INCLUDE

### Author info

• display_name  
• avatar_url

### Images

• all related image URLs

---

# 🚨 NEVER DO THIS

❌ fetch posts  
❌ then fetch users  
❌ then fetch images (N+1 queries)

---

# ✅ ALWAYS DO THIS

### SINGLE JOIN QUERY

Posts must return:

PostModel(
id,
title,
content,
authorName,
authorAvatar,
images[]
)

Comments must return:

CommentModel(
id,
content,
authorName,
authorAvatar,
images[]
)

---

# 🔹 Services

Supabase only  
Stateless  
Raw queries only  
No business logic

---

# 🔹 Repositories

Business logic only  
Combine services  
Handle validation + storage orchestration

---

# 🔹 ChangeNotifiers

Hold:
• loading  
• lists  
• cache  
• errors

No business logic.

---

# 🔹 Data Flow Example

Create Post:

Widget  
→ PostNotifier  
→ PostRepository  
→ StorageService.uploadImages  
→ BlogService.createPost  
→ return post WITH author + images  
→ notifyListeners

---

# 🔹 FINAL SUMMARY

users_jeremiah → auth + profile  
Services → Supabase only  
Repositories → business logic  
Notifiers → state  
UI → presentation only

Images:
✔ Cached  
✔ Shimmer loading  
✔ Always via AppImage

Posts/comments MUST always include:
✔ author display_name  
✔ author avatar  
✔ images

No Supabase Auth.


Keep boundaries strict.
